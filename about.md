	Actually I currently work at Expedia. When I joined the company they asked my to write a paragraph about myself. Here it is. 
	<blockquote>
		Hi everyone,
		My name is Georgy Petukhov (you can call me George). This May I finally graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with Bachelors in CS and came to Expedia to work as a Software Developer. I originally come from Russia where I lived until 17 years old and where my family still resides. As per Expedia requirements I really like to travel. I have visited about 30 countries, and plan to visit the rest 160. Some of more notable foreign adventures are Sweden/Arctic (2 months study abroad), Hong Kong (9 months study abroad), USA (undergrad degree abroad, work abroad, live abroad). I speak Russian, English and Mandarin. Aside from Computer Science, my hobbies are photography, learning Chinese, playing ping pong, watching indie/art-house movies, talking about international affairs and different cultures, complaining about American food, etc. I would really like to get to know everyone better so feel free to come over to my desk and say hi as well as get some strange food from me for free.

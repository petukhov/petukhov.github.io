This my first post in this blog. 

To be frank, it's not the first blog post ever because I used to have another Jekyll based blog before which had only one post "Hello World!". The problem with that blog was that I decided to style it myself, I wanted to create my own theme. And I did not want to start writing posts before the site looked pretty enough. Coming up with a good design is hard, coding it also takes time, and it I never finished the styling.  

So instead of writing posts in my non-existent custom personal blog I have instead decided to just write the posts in a blog, even if not designed by myself. Having your own blog is cool.

## Plans ## 

One of the plans for this blog is to write "Today I learnt"s regurarly whenever I learn something new. I heard it makes me remember the stuff better. 

The other plan is to write other random thoughts.

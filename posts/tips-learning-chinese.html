                I wish somebody told me all this 5 years ago.

            <h4>1. Chinese is a topic prominent language</h4>
            <p>
                When you just start learning Japanese (hold on, I'll get to Chinese in a second) you are introduced to the 'wa' particle which marks the word before it as the topic of the sentence, and the textbooks usually proceed to explain what the difference between subject and topic is while emphasizing that Japanese is a topic prominent language. (put definition here). Since Chinese lacks an explicit topic marker particle, the Chinese language textbooks that I read never mentioned the "topic" thing. Only recently when I started dabbling in Japanese and learnt about the topic marker I have decided to read more about it on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic-prominent_language">Wikipedia</a> where Chinese is also mentioned as an example of a topic promiment language. A lot of confusion I had about how Chinese grammar works suddenly got resolved. Here are some examples of simple Chinese sentence with a topic, not a subject. This kind of sentences are very common. (put examples here)
            </p>
            use 的 instead of which，that etc
            learn how not to use “instead of”。I played computer games instead of doing homework. 我在应该写作业的时候打了游戏
            Disregard time. Write sentences in such a way that time is ambiguous. It is kind of like present tense narrative in English.
            Don’t be afraid to be ambiguous. Be ambiguous unless meaning is not clear out of context.
            Don’t try to memorize the precise meanings of 会, 能，可以， 要。Especially 会。I think you can only get it from hundreds of examples.
            Living in the country makes your learning at least twice faster. It helps more than you think.
            Don’t translate from English to chinese，and especially from chinese to English. If you are just learning a language and not trying to become a translator, then it is a waste of time. translation is a separate skill。
